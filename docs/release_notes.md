DataTorrent RTS Release Notes
========================================================================================================================

Version: 3.8.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: Apr 18, 2017

### Summary

#### Application Templates (AppHub)
Pre-built data ingestion templates speed time-to-production
 
Deploy DataTorrent RTS application templates on a Hadoop distribution either on-premises or on the cloud. As part of this release, DataTorrent is providing AWS - EMR deployment script option for each available application template. As a result, development is simplified, enabling developers to more quickly and easily unlock value for customers. DataTorrent is focused on the goals of reducing complexity and removing dependency on Hadoop deployment, and this release represents progress in that direction.   

#### Application Configurations
Simplifying customized application launches
 
Users can start with a single Application Package and create multiple Application Configurations to launch and run the applications on different environments (for instance, in test and development).  And, efficiencies can be realized across business units: one Application Package could have multiple configurations for multiple internal units.  Each Application Configuration introduces a safety feature, which ensures that only one instance of Application Configuration can run at a time.  The status whether Application Configuration is running or not, and controls to launch and stop the application instance are provided in the Application Configuration view.  This set of features improves management, adds safety, and increases transparency when managing and launching applications.

### Debugging
Improving log visualizations to speed up debugging
 
#### StrAM Event Grouping
The StrAM Events widget helps from development and operations perspectives to visualize notable events from the application launch and throughout its ongoing run.  With this release, StrAM events widgets now offers better readability by organizing these events into related groups.  For example, when multiple downstream operators are re-deployed due to a container failure. All events triggered by the system to restore normal function will be grouped under a single root event which caused the restarts.  With this improved readability, the user can quickly identify failure causes and then drill down into the logs for each event.

#### Garbage Collection Widgets
With this release, developers can more easily visualize garbage collection data trends—as opposed to sifting through logs. Three widgets are available for GC visualizations:

* Garbage collection log chart by heap.  Visualizes when memory is allocated and deallocated 
* Garbage collection log table.  List memory allocation and deallocation details
* Garbage collection log chart by duration.  Visualizes how long it takes to deallocate memory 

#### Log Tailing & Search
Users can follow the logs as they are generated (tailing) with the RTS UI Console.  In this release, users can now also perform searches even when tailing to focus on specific events and exclude the noise.
 
#### Alert Templates
Simplifying and expanding alert functionality
 
In 3.7.0, RTS introduced monitoring with alerts that a DevOps engineer could set up based on specific conditions. The 3.8.0 release continues to simplify and expand this functionality by adding:

* Nine predefined system alert templates, including cluster and application memory usage, application status, and active container count, killed container alerts, etc.
* Option to disable alerts without deleting them.
* The ability to configure custom SMTP settings for sending alert emails, instead of relying on Gateway’s local node sendmail facility.
 
#### Security
 
Security enhancement in 3.8.0 applies to RTS deployment on secure Hadoop with Kerberos enabled. User's own Kerberos credentials can now be used directly by RTS to launch applications.  It is better from a security perspective.

The previous model involved using a single system user with Kerberos credential (Hadoop impersonation)  to launch applications. That requires access to the system Kerberos credential in order to refresh tokens before they expire.  With user’s own Kerberos credential, that is no longer the case. 
 
#### Licensing
 
With the release of 3.8.0, DataTorrent is updating and simplifying its licensing policy.  What has changed?  

Starting with 3.8, the Community Edition is no longer available. We are replacing the Community Edition with Free Edition.  Community Edition limited the features available to you, such as security.   Now with Free Edition you have access to all the features and tools of RTS up to a 128GB processing limit.

Please refer to the DataTorrent website for additional details.

#### Licensing FAQ
 
_I have a Community Edition license. Is that edition still available?_  
Starting with 3.8, the Community Edition is no longer available.   You can continue to use the Community Edition with RTS version 3.7.
 
_How is license memory consumption calculated?_  
License memory consumption is the sum of all running applications as can be seen in Configuration - License Information and Monitor.
 
_What will happen when my memory consumption exceed my license limit?_  
You’ll receive a warning, which is shown for 30 minutes before most RTS features will be disabled. All existing applications will continue to run. Should you need to upgrade, you can easily contact DataTorrent for a new license.
 
_How will I know when my license is going to expire and what happens if the license expires?_  
We provide warnings at 30 days and 7 days before expiration date.  When a license expires, most RTS features will be immediately disabled. All existing applications will continue to run. You can easily contact DataTorrent for a new license.  
 
_What can I do once RTS is locked (either because my license memory has been exceeded or its expiration date has passed)?_  
Users can view running applications and enter new license details to unlock RTS. The following capabilities are still accessible:

* Configure - System Configuration is available except for App Data Tracker
* Configure - License Information is available
* Configure - Installation Wizard is available
* Monitor - Application kill, inspect and shutdown are available
* Monitor - Application Overview (shutdown and kill only) per application is available
* Monitor - Containers (kill only)
* AppHub (download only, no import)
* Learn
 
_Can I reduce the number of applications and return to compliance?_  
Yes, you can do so if you have exceeded your memory capacity, assuming that your license has not expired

_Can I reduce the memory usage of an application and bring it back to license compliance?_  
Yes, assuming that your license has not expired.  Please note that you will have to restart the application.

_I have an enterprise license for my production cluster. Can I use the Free Edition in a non- production cluster?_  
Yes. It’s worth noting that only community support is available for the Free Edition. Please visit the DataTorrent User group for RTS-related questions: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/dt-users
 
For the Apache Apex mailing list and meetups information, please go to
https://apex.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists
 
_Can I buy DataTorrent support for Free Edition?_  
Unfortunately, no. DataTorrent support is sold as part of our Enterprise Edition. If you’re seeking support, you may consider upgrading.

_Is Application Master Container memory consumption included in the calculation for processing capacity?_  
Yes. Application Master Container consumes 1 GB by default and every application has its own Application Master. If application is not running, it does not run as well. It grows based on customer application build. Memory requirements increases along with the size of logical and physical DAG. Partitioners of an operator run in AppMaster.

#### Additional Features of 3.8.0
 
##### Multiple gateway support

This allows simultaneous multiple gateway operations and increase fault tolerance due to management console failure. 

When there are multiple gateways (usually for High Availability), different developers may access them at the same time, with different or same user accounts. These activities will often result in simultaneous modification of the same resource stored in HDFS, and invalidate cache entries on each client. For example: When developer A tries to save a configuration package and developer B has edited and saved the same package, developer A will get an error. Developer A would then have to manually merge the differences. This release introduces a new file-based locking mechanism with HTTP ETag header to handle that scenario.
Known limitation: Alerts and visualization works correctly with single gateway only.

##### Retain metric selections when returning to Monitor - Physical/Logical view
Better user experience since RTS will keep what users have selected to view (e.g. metrics) as they go from one screen to another.

Version: 3.7.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: Feb 28, 2017

### Summary
This is primarily for users who install RTS in a Kerberized cluster as application fails to launch in 3.7.0. This release fixes the issue. 

Other issues that are also fixed:

* In 3.6.0, users have the option to override certain properties from the config file. This ability was missing in 3.7.0.
* Gateway fails to recognize AppDataTracker application and it continuously relaunched on a Kerberized cluster.
* On a Kerberized cluster, when the configuration parameters are specified in the `dt-site.xml` file in the user's home directory, the installation wizard does not allow the user to continue with the installation.

### Appendix

#### Bug Fixes
* [SPOI-10698] - Allow Custom Properties with Config XML file while launching an application
* [SPOI-10737] - AppDataTracker application relaunches continuously and fails in a Kerberized cluster.
* [SPOI-10932] - Installation Wizard does not allow to complete gateway configuration
* [SPOI-10773] - Application fails to run in fully enabled Kerberized mode (APEXCORE-616 - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/APEXCORE-616)

Version: 3.7.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: Dec 30, 2016

### Summary
The new features on this release are functionalities that will ease debugging an application and administering application alerts in production. 

Operation related features for a Dev Ops role:  

* Manage and see a history of previous alerts so that users can be aware of potential issues before they become critical. 
* View operator ID(s) and name(s) in the dtManage-Physical-Container list table to quickly identify what operators are in each container. 
* Filter matching tuple recordings by searching across tuple recording data.

Debugging features: When trying to troubleshoot or debug a distributed system, these capabilities allow users to quickly identify problem areas and easily drill down into relevant details (i.e. logs). 

* Notify users when log files have been removed
* New Application Attempts section under Monitor. It is located along other views such as logical and physical
* New Application Master logs in Application Overview section
* New log button shortcut in Stram Events and Physical Operator section
* Show dead container logs in Running applications. That is to show history of physical operator containers and logs in the physical operator view. For each previous incarnation, there are start time, end time, link to corresponding logs, root cause with error code, and recovery window id.
* Show the same details for killed or finished application like running application view.
* Show container history as default in Physical Operator view
* New historic count field in Physical Operator view
* Get thread dump from a container. It is useful to analyze issues such as "stuck operator", and obtain statistics from the running JVM. In production environments users often don't have direct access to the machines, thus making it available through the REST API will help. 
* Option to auto tail container logs. When viewing a container log via the UI, there is an option to periodically poll for more data (i.e. "tail -f" effect).

dtAssemble

* New validate button so that user can validate DAG without having to save. 
* Remove auto save function. Save will be initiated by user only.
* Support custom JSON input for tuple schema creation. This is particularly useful when user needs to add a large number of fields. 

dtDashboard

* New gauge widget

AppHub

* Continued to refine application templates in AppHub (introduced in RTS 3.6.0).  

RTS 3.7.0 is based on Apache Apex Core 3.5.0 (released Dec 19, 2016) and Apache Apex Malhar 3.6.0 (released Dec 8, 2016).

### Apache Apex Core 3.5.0
This release upgrades the Apache Hadoop YARN dependency from 2.2 to 2.6. The community determined that current users run on versions equal or higher than 2.6 and Apex can now take advantage of more recent capabilities of YARN. The release contains a number of important bug fixes and operability improvements. 
Change log: https://github.com/apache/apex-core/blob/v3.5.0/CHANGELOG.md

### Apache Apex Malhar 3.6.0 
The release adds first iteration of SQL support via Apache Calcite. Features include SELECT, INSERT, INNER JOIN with non-empty equi join condition, WHERE clause, SCALAR functions that are implemented in Calcite, custom scalar functions. Endpoint can be file, Kafka or internal streaming port for both input and output. CSV format is implemented for both input and output. See examples for usage of the new API.

The windowed state management has been improved (WindowedOperator). There is now an option to use spillable data structures for the state storage. This enables the operator to store large states and perform efficient checkpointing.

There was also benchmarking on WindowedOperator with the spillable data structures. From the result, the community significantly improved how objects are serialized and reduced garbage collection considerably in the Managed State layer. Work is still in progress for purging state that is not needed any more and further improving the performance of Managed State that the spillable data structures depend on. More information about the windowing support can be found at http://apex.apache.org/docs/malhar/operators/windowedOperator/.

This release also adds a new, alternative Cassandra output operator (non-transactional, upsert based) and support for fixed length file format to the enrichment operator. 
Change log: https://github.com/apache/apex-malhar/blob/v3.6.0/CHANGELOG.md

Version 3.5.0 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date: Sep 26, 2016

### Summary
DataTorrent RTS continues to deliver features that sets it apart in bringing operability in running an enterprise grade big data-in-motion platform. This particular release brought new features such as

* Allowing users to analyze "stuck operator" by obtaining stats from the running JVM (i.e. GC stats and thread dump)
* Ability to show/hide critical path in both logical and physical DAG

### Apache Apex Malhar
The other important part of going to production is a library of operators that is more than just functional. They need to be fault tolerant, partitionable, support idempotency, and dynamically scalable. The recent release of Apache Apex Malhar 3.5.0 provides new and updated operators and APIs to bring those enterprise features. 

* Windowed Operator that supports the windowing semantics outlined by Apache Beam and Google Cloud DataFlow, including the concepts of event time windows, session windows, watermarks, allowed lateness, and triggering.
* High level Java stream API now uses the aforementioned Windowed Operator to support stateful transformation with Apache Beam style windowing semantics.
* Introduction of Spillable Data Structures that make use of Managed State.
* Deduper Operator to process  whether a given record is a duplicate or not
* Enricher Operator to join a stream with a lookup source and operate on any POJO object
* HBase input operator. Improve HBasePOJOInputOperator with support for threaded read
* File Record reader module. It is useful for reading from files "line by line" in parallel and emit each line as seperate * tuple.
* JDBC Poll Input Operator

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Summary
Affinity rules provides a way to specify hints on how operators should be deployed in a Hadoop cluster. There are two types of rules: affinity and anti-affinity rules. Affinity rule indicates that the group of operators in the rule should be allocated together. Anti-affinity rule, the new feature in Apache Apex 3.4.0, indicates that the group of operators should be allocated separately.

This release also includes a lot of bug fixes. Please see appendix for full list. 

### dtManage
* User can restart a killed application from dtManage
* "Retrieve Ended Apps" button changes to "Hide Ended Apps" after dtManage retrieves killed apps.

### Summary

#### dtHub
DataTorrent RTS allows companies to quickly build low latency real time Big Data application that can scale and fault tolerant. With the introduction of dtHub, DataTorrent now host and maintain an application distributor. You can access it through dtManage and easily install or update application without having to upgrade the whole RTS platform. Prior to dtHub, RTS installer packaged both platform and applications. In 3.3, they are decoupled with significantly reduced installer size. You can independently choose when to upgrade the platform and when to install/upgrade applications.

#### dtManage
* Troubleshooting is made easier now that user can view the containers where physical operators have lived
* RTS Community Edition user can now view container logs and set log levels via dtManage. API for runtime DAG and property change are also available
* RTS Enterprise Edition is changed from 30 days to 60 days
* When an application is killed, RTS will delete the app directory according to policy  in dt-site.xml

#### dtDasbhoard
* New widgets for the dashboard: Geo coordinates with circles, Geo regions with gradient fill and single Value 

#### dtAssemble (beta)
* Top level “Develop” takes users directly to Application Page
* Navigation changes on how user get to Tuple Schema. User goes to It is now "Edit Application" then "Tuple Schema"
* Development (breadcrumb link)

#### Documentation 
* FileSplitter: http://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/file_splitter/
* Block Reader: http://docs.datatorrent.com/operators/block_reader/

#### Apache Apex 3.3 
* Support for iterative processing. It is a building block to support machine learning
* Ability to populate DAG at application launch time
* Pre checkpoint operator callback so that it can execute a logic before the operator gets checkpointed (e.g. flush file to HDFS)
* Provide the option for operator to do checkpointing in a distribute in-memory store. It is faster than HDFS due to disk i/o latency
* Add group ID information in an applicatin package.  It is visible for application grouping in dtHub.
